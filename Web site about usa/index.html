    <h1>History <br/> Mexican–American War</h1>
    <div class="history-details">
    <p>Between 1846 and 1848 (exactly when Latter-day Saint pioneers began their migration to the Great Salt Lake Valley) 
        The United States of America and Mexico were engaged in a war that changed the social and political landscape of the 
        North American West. The Saints not only faced the consequences of this war as they sought to resettle and establish settlements,
         but some also took part in it by joining the Mormon Battalion.
         The war began over disagreements between the two countries over the Republic of Texas, a large area in the middle of the continent claimed by the Spanish, 
         Mexicans, white settlers from the United States of America, and the Comanche Indian tribe. The Congress of the United States of America proposed statehood
          to the Republic of Texas, and the proposal was accepted; Mexico considered it an annexation. A border dispute in the Rio Grande region escalated into armed clashes, 
          and in 1846 Congress declared war on Mexico.
          The US Army invaded Mexico in early 1847 and captured Mexico City by the end of that year.
           In 1848, the two countries concluded the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, under which the war ended.
            A huge part of the territory passed to the United States of America, including the region where the Latter-day Saints decided to settle.
           Part of the territory ceded to the United States of America</p>

    <h1>History <br/> of Civil War in US</h1>
    <div class="history-details">
    <p>The American Civil War (1861-1865), also called the War of the North and the South,
         has gone down in history as the largest and bloodiest conflict on the American continent.
          In this article, we will tell you how the war began, developed and how it ended, which forever changed the United States of America.
          In the early 1860s, a series of sharp political,
           economic and ethical contradictions arose between the North and South of the United States, 
           which led to the split of the country. After that,
            a civil war began where both sides wanted to control all of America under their own kind of rule.</p>

    <h1>History <br/>of Cold War </h1>
    <div class="history-details">
    <p>The Cold War is a global geopolitical, military, economic and ideological confrontation on a world scale in the period from 1946 to the end of the 1980s between two blocs of states with different social and economic systems.

        The center of the socialist camp was the USSR, the center of the capitalist Western world was the USA.
         This confrontation was not a war in international legal terminology. Also, one of the main components of the confrontation
          was the ideological struggle -
         that is, the struggle of the USSR and the USA for a dominant position in world public opinion after World War II.</p>
